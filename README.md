# Simple Angular Notes App

## Why?

The scope of a notes app is quite small and a great way to kick the tyres of a framework.


## What is this?

This is a simple notes app to explore the functionality of Googles [Angular 1.5.9](http://angularjs.org) framework. I have built apps in various methods on purpose to learn how angular can handle each method.
The folder structures are very similar but each app may vary slightly.
I hope this repository helps others that are interested in getting started with Angular.


## How to use

I recommend using the fantastic [BrowserSync](https://browsersync.io/) to run this app.

```
npm install -g browser-sync
browser-sync start --server --port 3001 --files="./prototypal/*"
```
