# Simple Angular Notes App

## Why?

The scope of a notes app is quite small and a great way to kick the tyres of a framework.


## What is this?

This is a simple notes app to explore the functionality of [Angular 1.5.9](http://angularjs.org) framework.
Each apps has been built with a different programming method and is located in its respective folder, 
the purpose of this was to learn how angular handles each method.
The folder structures are very similar but each app may vary slightly.
I hope this repository helps others that are interested in getting started with Angular.


## How to use

I recommend using [BrowserSync](https://browsersync.io/) to run each app.
Change the pathname to suit which app you would like to run.

```
npm install -g browser-sync
browser-sync start --server --port 3001 --files="./prototypal/*"
```
