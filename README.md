# Simple Notes App

## Why?

The scope of a notes app is quite small and a great way to introduce and kick the tyres of a framework.

## What is this?

This is a simple notes app to explore the functionality of Googles [AngularJS 1](http://angularjs.org) framework.

Current Features

- Add Note.
- Delete Note.

## How to use

I recommend using the fantastic [BrowserSync](https://browsersync.io/) to run this app.

```
npm install -g browser-sync
browser-sync start --server --port 3001 --files="./*"
```
